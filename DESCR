Go implementation of djb's redo, Makefile replacement that sucks less.

Originally it was just a rewrite of redo-c, but later most features of
apenwarr/redo were also implemented. Why yet another implementation? It
is featureful and has better performance comparing to shell and Python
implementation.

It passes tests from redo-sh.tests and implementation-neutral ones from
apenwarr/redo.
